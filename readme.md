# Pretty Music

## Step 1 (Rainmeter inspired)

Create WASAPI capture client in loopback mode and read byte stream

Process byte streams and generate loudness array based on fft calculations

## Step 1.5 (Generate Visualization)

Using fft loudness array previously calculated create gui based frequency renderer

Using <fill in later> gui builder to display frequencies

Register program as service/run in background

## Step 2 (Light Strip)

Synchronize colored lights to audio output derived in previous step

Use Arduino to handle changing light colors

## Step 3 (Remote)

Try to get bluetooth updates for arduino and pc

Create custom bluetooth driver

## Step 4 (Cube)

Cover lights in resin to ensure vibeyness
